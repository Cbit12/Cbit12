# Hi there, I'm Carolin Bittrich 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an Industrial Engineer turned Fullstack Web Developer with a passion for creating interactive and functional web applications. I've spent the majority of my career in the commercial sector of large companies, but this year, I decided to pivot my career and dive into the world of web development.

## 🚀 My Journey

- 📚 I recently completed a Fullstack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) bootcamp in Coding Dojo (Latam), where I gained hands-on experience with the following technologies:
  - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Material UI
  - React and Vite for building frontend applications
  - Express and Node.js for server-side development
  - MongoDB for database management

- 🌱 I'm excited to apply my newfound skills and knowledge to real-world projects and continue learning and growing as a developer.

## 💼 Looking for Opportunities

I'm actively seeking remote job opportunities where I can contribute my skills and expertise to build creative and functional web applications. I'm passionate about creating user-friendly, responsive, and efficient solutions that solve real-world problems.
